          OI Chain analysis:

          OI Chain information will help you to decide, where to enter Call or Put, whether to hold back entered trade, or to book profit or loss.

          Wait for Price to reach Strong Support or Strong Resistance and once it reaches check few strike of ITM and OTM from ATM strike,
          lets say 3 from each side and see what is happening with PUT and CALLS (SB, LB, LU, SS) like which side writers are supporting (adding more contracts) and who is running away ( closing contracts)..

          If trend is reversing based on above points, take small risk wil lesser Stop Loss, and reward will be good

          Don't take trades if data is not clearly telling whether trend is changing or not (like doji)

          Have patience before taking trade. WAIT WAIT WAIT for the price to reach the SUPPORT or RESISTANCE strike.

          Let Big fish decide who is strong near that points and then swim with them on their side

          Enter into PE if reversing from Resistance strike by looking at CALL side data.

          Enter into CE if reversing from Support strike by looking at PUT side data.

          NOTE:  Be ready to change the party, You don't have to have predetermined mindset, look at the data, decide the trend direction.
